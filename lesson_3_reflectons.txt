What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository a .git folder is formed in the the main repository. We need to do
this so that the git is setup and can start tracking the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
 think it offers?
The staging are contains the files that are tracked by git. i.e if there are any changes git will
consider those, also the commits happen on the staging area, the copy is formed only of the staging
are and not of the untracked files. This provides the users a lot of flexibility in terms which files
one should track and which should not.
